            <p>Factories again?? Yes! Factories also produce a lot of liquid waste such as dirty water, used chemicals and oils, sewage and cafeteria waste into nearby water bodies polluting them and killing the marine life living there!</p>

            <h1>Plastic Waste</h1>
            <p>Plastic waste is one of the biggest problems in our society today. We use plastics everyday, especially single use plastics. What happens to them after use? They are thrown away usually into oceans and other large water bodies where they stay forever in large groups called garbage patches. These patches usually suffocate many marine animals, killing them.</p>

            <h1>Overfishing</h1>
            <p>Overfishing is another huge problem in our society. This is just another word for fishing but which is done on a huge scale. Fishing is not bad, but overfishing is. People use huge fishing nets and even explosives to collect fish! And this is done at such a huge scale that the fish can't reproduce fast enough to keep up! As a result, many fish are dying! Along with them, other bigger fish who eat those fishes are dying because of lack of food!</p>

        <p>All this was very sad to learn about but it's something that happens everyday. What can you do? Why not consider donating to one of the organisations in the <a href="donations.html">donations page</a>.</p>

        <p>Also, why not hear what the ocean has to say about this?</p>
