            <h1>Deforestation</h1>
            <p>Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees by cutting them down to make room for other human activities, mainly animal farming. It is one of the most harmful things man has been doing to nature because less trees will mean less oxygen. Deforestation also leads to floods and erosion(which limits plant growth). It also means that many animals such as monkeys lose their home.</p>

            <h1>Mining</h1>
            <p>Mining is the process by which natural resources are extracted from the Earth. It might seem harmless but the chemicals released from the process can completely destroy the nature around it. It is very harmful to humans as well.</p>

            <h1>Poaching</h1>
            <p>Poaching is the illegal hunting/killing of animals for their skins, husks, horns etc. It is very harmful to nature as it means that many animals are lost. Sometimes, when the animals survive, they lose their important organs such as husks or horns. It also makes the animals evolve without their iconic organs which makes us lose our biodiversity within animals.</p>
